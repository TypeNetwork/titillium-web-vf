* Titillium Web VF
** FontBakery Status
*** Roman
**** Fails 03 ****
******* TODO :: integer_ppem_if_hinted
      
	This needs to be fixed:
	I tryed adding the "-t" flag to ttfautohint
	Didn't work.
	I also looks at other fonts with ttx, no luck

******* TODO :: ots
      
	Maybe this isn't and issue:
	https://github.com/khaledhosny/ots/issues/178
	I might still try to fix this but it's not a top priority.

******* TODO [#C] :: valid_glyphnames
      
	This can be fixed but it's not top priority
	Need to use a custom Glyphs XML file
      
**** Warns 03 ****
******* :: unitsperem_strict

	Not an issue, can upscale in Glyphs if needed

******* TODO :: family_and_style_max_length

	Fix with ttx post build?

******* :: points_out_of_bounds

	Have not looked yet, but this seems ok.

******* DONE :: gpos_kerning_info
	CLOSED: [2019-03-26 Tue 14:09]

	This is fixed now. I have to make sure the kerning info 
	in glyphs is consistant across masters.
